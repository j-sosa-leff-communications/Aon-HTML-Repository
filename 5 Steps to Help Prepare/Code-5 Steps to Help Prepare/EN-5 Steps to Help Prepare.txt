            Risk managers already face a plethora of challenges as they seek risk resilience, including balanding rising rates with 
            shrinking corporate risk budgets. Now, they can add increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks and the rising cost 
            of cyber risk to the list of challenges.

            Rising cyber threats are increasing both the difficulty and the importance of risk managers' efforts to take control of their risk. 
            Cyber risk is no longer solely a technology issue but also an enterprise risk issue, and it's coming under heightened scrutiny from the C-suite,
            the boardroom and investors.

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                As cyber attacks have risen in frequency and severity, so have insurance losses. The days of
                inexpensive cyber insurance coverage have ended. Insurers are under extreme pressure to
                increase rates, tighten underwriting criteria and restrict capacity — or even exit the cyber
                market entirely — as cyber-insurance-combined ratios have risen dramatically.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Companies can anticipate rate increases as high as 80% into 2022 as carriers work to atone 
                for growing losses in their cyber-risk books of business.⁹

                    1. Create a multidisciplinary committee for cyber risk management: 
                </span>
                The impact of cyber risk can be felt across every
                department in a business — from legal to compliance, human resources, finance, communications, operations,
                information technology and elsewhere. A cyber risk committee is a relatively low cost organizational change that
                brings together the relevant expertise to assess how cyber risk will impact multiple functions, and how changes in
                the business — such as an M&A transaction, working with a new vendor, or implementing new technologies — will
                alter the security posture. The General Counsel, who has an apolitical position in the organization, as well as
                familiarity with the regulatory environment and downstream liabilities should chair this multidisciplinary committee
                and report out to the CEO and Board with their findings.

                    2. Conduct a security assessment: 
                </span>
                The best way to understand the current state of a company’s security, is to conduct
                an independent security assessment. Smaller organizations with less complex systems may consider SaaS-based
                solutions, which can be cheaper and allow IT or information security leaders to input information and receive an
                instant score on their security posture. The results of the assessment should then be shared with the
                multidisciplinary committee so as to inform where budget is spent to close gaps, prioritize critical data and assets
                for protection, and what to insure. Investing in red team exercises¹⁰ will help expose weakness and identify priorities
                for remediation before a real attack can strike.

                    3. Create a culture of security: 
                </span>
                Weaponize your employees in the fight against cybercrime by investing in the right
                training and awareness programs, with a focus on engaging programs that change human behavior. No one should
                be exempt from these exercises — including the board and senior executives. For example, proactively teaching
                people how to spot suspicious phishing emails as well as implementing better password management practices.
                These small security strategies can have an immediate positive effect.

                Incident response planning focuses on improving the company’s resilience in the face
                of attacks.¹¹ Many companies now have an incident response plan, but it’s important to test the plan with all
                stakeholders involved and keep it regularly updated. Planning for an incident — particularly ransomware — also
                involves creating regular back-ups of critical data and systems to reduce downtime, and testing defenses, all by
                simulating attacks.

                Even after taking a number of proactive steps such as those outlined above,
                the evolving threat landscape means that no company can be completely secure. It’s important to ensure that any
                cyber insurance policy considers the risk exposures of greatest concern to the company, as there is no “one size fits
                all” from a coverage standpoint. A cyber policy should always be treated as part of a broader cyber security strategy
                that has, at its heart, a proactive approach to risk mitigation.
