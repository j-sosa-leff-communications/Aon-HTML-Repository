            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                After a number of stops and starts in 2021,
                employers are in the midst of bringing employees
                back to their workplaces. There are several
                potential COVID-19-related exposures that may
                emerge as organizations reopen their offices with
                uncertainty around the vaccination status of their
                workforce, including disability discrimination,
                emotional distress claims, wrongful terminations
                and retaliation, age discrimination, labor unrest,
                failure to protect and wrongful death.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                As a best practice, employers should review their
                EPLI policy to assess whether it will respond to
                these evolving COVID-19-related issues in
                respect of employment matters. To assess
                coverage for any potential claims, EPLI policies
                should be reviewed for Bodily Injury/Property
                Damage (BI/PD) exclusions and potential
                carve-backs. Coverage would depend on the
                language used in the policy.

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Medical and recreational marijuana continues to
                be a thorny issue in the workplace following the
                legalization of marijuana in Canada and select U.S.
                states. Employers must walk a fine line between
                compliance with employment law protecting
                employee rights, a patchwork of federal, state and
                provincial laws that prohibit working under the
                influence of marijuana and their own company
                drug use and safety policies. EPLI policies can
                provide coverage for a host of accusations that
                may arise resulting from the intersection of
                cannabis and the workplace, spanning from
                discrimination based on a disability to wrongful
                dismissal allegations.

                </span>
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                In the midst of continued worldwide focus on
                sexual harassment allegations in the workplace,
                various Canadian jurisdictions have created
                statutory obligations for companies to investigate
                and address workplace harassment complaints,
                and to develop and maintain programs and
                policies that explicitly address sexual
                harassment. In Ontario, for example, this came in
                the form of amendments to the province’s
                Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA). An
                employer’s failure to comply can result in a
                mandated third-party investigation and report at
                the company’s expense, or a hefty fine. Although
                most EPLI policies exclude violations of the OHSA,
                and its associated fines and penalties, some EPLI
                programs will respond to provide certain
                indemnity and defense costs coverage in the
                event a company is faced with a civil lawsuit
                alleging harassment or sexual harassment.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Meanwhile, in the U.S., local, state and federal laws
                offer a variety of prohibitions against sexual
                harassment differing mostly in the type of
                available damages, but also regarding mandatory
                training requirements in some states. State and
                local laws often provide the plaintiffs’ bar with
                uncapped damage and punitive damage award
                potential, making it more common that these
                suits are brought under state and local laws.
                However, similarly complex state insurance laws
                require careful analysis to ensure EPLI policies
                can respond to these types of punitive and
                intentional act-related awards.

                </span>
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Various privacy-related torts have been
                recognized in recent years in Canadian
                jurisdictions. With the broadening of privacy
                rights, employers must be careful in balancing
                employees’ reasonable expectations of privacy
                and, for instance, surveillance and searches or
                public announcements or statements
                involving employees.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                In the U.S., there have been two significant trends
                in the area of employee privacy. The first relates
                to the capture of biometric information from
                employees such as eye scans, fingerprints or the
                use of facial recognition software. In Illinois in
                particular, but also in a growing number of other
                states, laws have been passed to make the
                capture of such information illegal without the
                written authorization of the employee. Many
                employee class actions have been brought in
                Illinois under its Biometric Information Projection
                Act (BIPA). The COVID-19 pandemic has been
                another area of significant employee privacy
                concern. Both contact tracing as a result of an
                infection and the growing push for employers to
                learn whether employees have obtained the
                COVID-19 vaccine have increased the likelihood of
                privacy-related lawsuits in this area as well.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Many EPLI policies provide some measure of
                coverage for invasion of privacy claims, although
                the extent of coverage varies among carriers and
                may differ depending on whether the insured is a
                public or private company. Recently, given the
                rise in BIPA-related lawsuits, some carriers have
                begun to actively look to either underwrite or
                exclude coverage for biometric
                information-related matters.

                </span>
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Traditionally, discrimination claims based on
                race, ethnicity and age have been commonly
                covered under EPLI policies, but insurance and
                legal practitioners are expecting to see an uptick
                in litigation in more recent grounds of human
                rights discrimination as well. In recent years,
                legislation has evolved to both recognize
                expanding rights such as LGBTQ+ rights and
                gender identity, as well as realities such as
                work-life balance. It is vital for EPLI policies to
                respond in the event of discrimination based on,
                among other things, sexual orientation,
                transgender status, or gender dysphoria. Equally
                important is coverage for other grounds of
                discrimination such as family status (expressly
                recognized by the Canadian Human Rights
                Tribunal). EPLI policies typically provide broad
                coverage in this regard, which in most cases will
                extend to cover claims stemming from these
                novel bases of discrimination.

                </span>
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Termination of an employee can come with
                potential risk and litigation if not conducted
                carefully. In Canada, claims for wrongful
                dismissal are generally accompanied by disputes
                over the amount of pay-in-lieu of notice to
                which a terminated employee is entitled.
                Notably, common law notice periods in Canada
                have recently increased to an upper threshold of
                26 months. In the U.S., wrongful termination
                claims can take many forms even with its
                supposed employment at-will nature of the
                employee relationship.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                The Canadian EPLI market now offers coverage
                by some carriers, subject to terms and
                conditions, for some of the wages ultimately
                awarded by a court that are over and above the
                statutory minimums required by legislation, or
                the amount that is offered to the employee at or
                after the time of termination.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                In the U.S., wrongful termination is broadly
                covered because the damages are much less
                formulaic and statutory based than in Canada.
                Therefore, wrongful termination claims are a
                major source of exposure addressed by EPLI in
                the U.S.

            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                Dependent contractors find themselves
                somewhere on the job classification spectrum
                between employees and independent
                contractors. Canadian courts have generally
                classified a dependent contractor as an
                individual who works for themselves but
                provides consistent and regular services to one
                or a limited number of organizations. As a result,
                that individual is entitled to many of the same
                rights as an employee. Traditionally, EPLI polices
                did not extend to cover individuals in these
                positions. However, the Canada insurance
                market has begun to move in a favorable
                direction for insureds, with policies now
                providing coverage for claims involving
                dependent contractors.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                In the U.S., the advent of the gig economy has
                resulted in a blurring of the spectrum between
                independent contractors and employees as well.
                In response, employment laws have tended to
                make it easier for workers who have entered
                into clear agreements stating they are not
                employees of a particular organization to sue as
                if they were employees. As a result, brokers have
                worked diligently with the insurance market to
                seek to expand coverage treating employment
                claims for otherwise covered wrongful acts
                brought by these non-traditional employees to
                be treated as employment claims covered under
                EPLI policies. That is, as long as the worker is
                claiming to be an employee, which is typically a
                requirement for the plaintiff to allege to bring a
                claim under most U.S. employment laws.

            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                “Wage and hour” claims have increased in both
                frequency and severity over the past few years.
                These claims are frequently brought as class
                action lawsuits, with large groups of employees
                seeking millions of dollars in damages for
                matters such as unpaid wages, unpaid overtime
                and job misclassification leading to wages or
                other benefits owed. To address this exposure,
                coverage for lawsuits related to employee wages
                may be available for larger U.S. and Canadian
                policyholders who may face significant losses in
                a wage and hour class action lawsuit. This is
                typically priced much higher than traditional
                EPLI insurance. The cost of this coverage has
                recently decreased, but remains relatively high,
                as does the retention, due to litigation trends in
                this area.
