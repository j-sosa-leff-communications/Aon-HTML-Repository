                It's extremely beneficial to benchmark yourself against your industry peers when trying to determine optimal limits and retention and deductible levels. 
                If your company's insurance rate is lower thanyour peers, you can explain to the C-suite the steps you've taken to control losses and retain a better rate than 
                your competitors. Conversely, if you're paying more than the industry average, those metrics could indicate the need to introduce new 
                alternative risk-financing vehicles into the mix — such as captives, parametric insurance or a different retention strategy. A strong broker 
                can provide industry data comparisons that can help you position your company among your peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing how you stack up against competitors could influence your rates. The proactive next move, then, is to 
                figure out how to differentiate your individual risk so that you get to the better side of the industry average.</p>

                A plethora of metrics are available, but it's important to be strategic about what you use and how you use it. 
                That's because the data presented to the C-suite must be focused on the real drivers of your business and on its risk management strategy. 
                Take location, for instance. If you're an Iowa-based company, metrics on hurricane risk won't be relevant to your narrative. 
                Similarly, rates, retention, deductibles, placement specifics and other factors must be viewed through the lens of your risk history. 
                If you have all your insurance through one carrier or have significant loss experience, the metrics pertinent to you will be 
                completely different from those of a firm with shared or layered insurance or little to no loss experience.

            <h3 style="width: 40%; margin: 0px 10px; color: #46545f;">3. Focus on What's Important to Executives</h3>
            <span style="width: 5%; margin-left: auto; font-weight: bold; font-size: 3rem; color: #46545f;" onclick="close3()">×</span>
        </div>
        <div style="width:95%; margin: 20px auto; color: #46545f;">
            <p>
                So much of making metrics matter comes down to understanding the motivations of the C-suite. CFOs may have certain metrics 
                that they're used to or that mattered in an industry in which they have previous experience. Knowing this will help you understand how much of 
                your narrative around metrics needs to focus on education and breaking down potential preconceived notions of which numbers matter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, understanding the hot-button issues for the C-suite will help you choose which metrics to highlight. 
                If your firm just acquired facilities in California, for example, it's important to understand the earthquake exposure 
                of those facilities and the options to mitigate that risk in the traditional or alternative markets. The better you can anticipate 
                the concerns of executives, know your organization's risk profile,and provide ways to build risk resilience, problem-solve or recognize 
                overall organizational concerns, the more impactful your narrative will be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Approaching metrics from this strategic standpoint will also create the chance for a follow-up opportunity with executives 
                and shift the conversation from reducing insurance costs to mitigating and transferring risk to help the overall business operate more efficiently.

                While the data and analytics capabilities of companies and insurers are improving everyday, work remains to enhance metric reporting. 
                Some organizations may not have the information needed to perform proper data analytics. Other firms may have that information, 
                but risk managers may not know where it lives or how to extract insights. That's why risk managers should work with their brokers to lay 
                out a long-term roadmap for metrics, often developing it over several years. Over time, as the data collected become more robust, 
                the analytics capabilities and models used will be tweaked and refined. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The sooner you can get the C-suite on board with such an approach, the more effective — and successful — your property insurance metrics journey will be.</p>
